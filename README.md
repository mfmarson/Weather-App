# Weather App Project

This repository contains a simple weather application, demonstrating skills in React, TypeScript, and AWS cloud services (Lambda, API Gateway, S3, CloudFront).

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript
- **Backend:** AWS Lambda (Node.js with TypeScript), AWS API Gateway
- **Deployment:** AWS S3 (static hosting), AWS CloudFront (CDN)
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub

## Project Overview

The application allows users to enter a city name to retrieve current weather details (temperature, conditions, humidity, etc.) from a 3rd-party weather API. All API requests are proxied securely through an AWS Lambda backend to prevent exposure of the API key on the frontend. The frontend is statically hosted on AWS S3/CloudFront.

## Setup & Local Development

_(This section will be expanded with detailed instructions later)_

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm or yarn
- An AWS Account
- An API Key from a 3rd-party weather service (OpenWeatherMap)

## Development Log

This section outlines the key milestones and progress made during the development of this weather application not found in commits.

### Initial Setup

- Created project repository and initialized Git.
- Set up root `README.md` with initial structure and tech stack.
- Backend Project Initialization & TypeScript Setup
- Frontend Project Setup

## API Integration & Security

_(Will describe how the 3rd-party API is integrated and how the API key is secured)_

## Error Handling

_(Will describe the approach to graceful error handling)_

## Bonus Points Achieved

_(Will list any bonus points implemented)_
